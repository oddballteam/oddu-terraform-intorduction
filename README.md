# oddu-terraform-intorduction
This repository is meant for a general/basic introduction to Terraform

## Prerequisites

- Included is an mdp specific markdown file (oddu_terraform.md). In order to view this in "presentation" style, you will need the [mdp tool](https://github.com/visit1985/mdp).
  - Once installed, you can simply `mdp oddu_terraform.md` to see the file in presentation mode.
- In order to try out Terraform you will need to [download it](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).
- You will need an actual "playground" to actually build any infrastructure.
